Also, the Job pipeline is seamless, the UI is great and very attractive. The automations are very helpful since it now saves a lot of our time which went in sharing status updates by calling/emailing candidates manually.",

    "description": "We've been using Cutshort for over a year now and it has been the single largest source of our tech talent by some margin! In addition, the software tooling they've built allows for a tremendous amount of automation and filtering. The built in tooling for screening automation is fantastic. As a founder initially doing the talent sourcing myself, it was immensely valuable. Now, our talent acquisition team loves it too. They also have very good customer service and fantastic onboarding.",

While the rich feature set is a boon, what makes it truly stand apart is its ease of use and intuitive flows. In our experience, Cutshort is easily the best platform currently in India. About 60% of our hires have been through this platform. Thank You Team Cutshort. Hats off to you for having a great team that empathizes and listens to the clients' needs!",
